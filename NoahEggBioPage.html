  <h1>Noah Egierski Bio</h1>

<div id="Bio/CS">
  <h2> My name is Noah Egierski and I am 16 years old.
I am a student at Riley High School and will graduate in 2021.
I take the class Computer Science 1, and I usually enjoy it a lot.
We do things like Python, Scratch, App Inventor, and HTML.
Python so far has been the most difficult to use, but with practice comes the better skills. I am not very good at explaining things, but here we go.

This bit of code simply makes it so that when the screen starts, it erases whatever was done before it. You also choose which background choice you would like and it carries it over to the second screen.</h3></iframe> </div>

  <div class="col">This code is the main altered part of the code from the 1.4.5 assignment. We imported all of the necessary pieces that would be used for the main bulk of the code. Then we create the new operation which creates the actual border for the image. It takes the size of all of the images (1980x1040) and creates a background that is 10% larger than the image. You can then change the code that will change the color manually. </div>
  <div class="col"> <h4>This is the code that we only minorly altered to create the proper things needed for the photos output. It finds the correct directory, and simply saves the altered images in a new folder. It's pretty simple when it comes down to it. </h4></div>
